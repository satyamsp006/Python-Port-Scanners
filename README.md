# Python-Port-Scanners
A tool to scan open ports made by using python.

The "terrible_port_scanner.py" needs the TARGET_Hostname as it's Argument, it will automatically scan from port 1 to 1024 by default. 
It is very much simple and compact but slow in execution.

The "port_scan.py" is upgraded by using threading and also the time module which is way more faster than the other one. It needs TARGET_Hostname START_PORT END_PORT as it's Arguments.

Both the tools are completely written in python programming language.
